# mtcars Presentation Project README


## Overview

This repo contains my work from the week 3 project from the
[Developing Data Products][1] class from Johns Hopkins University within the
[Data Science Specialization][2] on Coursera. The original instructions for the
project can be found beneath the brief description section below. The script,
markdown, and html files were created in RStudio.

## Brief Description

The original instructions for this assignment are shown below. We were free to
choose our own topic and data source, and I decided on the `mtcars` data from
the `datasets` package. There are three main files in this repo: a script, an
Rmd file, and the html report. The project began with the script, where the
basics of the project were completed. The script was then reorganized into an
R markdown file. The Rmd file was then knit into an html presentation which was
the deliverable for the assignment.

>Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created
with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your
webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain
a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
