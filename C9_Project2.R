# Plot of mtcars Data


# The purpose of this script is to complete the basic requirements behind the
# project 2 peer-graded assignment which is part of the Developing Data Products
# course from Johns Hopkins University within the Data Science Specialization on
# Coursera.
#
# The instructions say:
# "Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created
# with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
# Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must
# contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your
# creativity!"
#
# This project will meet the objective by creating a plot of the mtcars data
# which is the only input for the script.
